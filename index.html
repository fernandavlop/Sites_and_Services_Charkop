          <h2>The Sites and Services Approach</h2>
          <p>In the early 1980’s the World Bank established a “sites and services” project in Charkop, Mumbai, which aimed to provide incremental, affordable housing solutions to lower and middle income groups in the region. The site was divided into different sized plots of land that were supported with basic infrastructure. Residents who moved to the site paid a below market rate over 20 years for the land and built houses at their own pace, adding floors and renovating as they could. The project did not achieve the intended outcomes in the timeline initially defined; as a result the Bank abandoned the “sites and services” approach. Twenty years later the site was revisited and observed to be a flourishing mixed income and mixed use neighborhood.

          <h2>Charkop today</h2>
          <p>The Charkop neighborhood today consists of nine sectors which have gradually developed over the last 30 years. Sectors 1-7 are the original sites-and-services locations in Charkop that were planned by the Mumbai government with support from the World Bank. Sectors 8 and 9 appear
          to be newer developments and are less dense and less integrated into the rest of the neighborhood – both are along the Gorai and Manori creeks to the northwest of  the neighborhood. These sectors also appear to be less mixed-use, as there are fewer businesses and services in these areas. Sectors 1-7 are in close proximity to one another and are walkable both within and across sectors.

          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>The interconnection of the original physical and administrative design elements of the sites and services project laid the groundwork for the development and sustainability of this livable community. At its core, the small and dense households organized around a shared semi-private outdoor space fostered opportunities for social interaction and mutual needs to be met that led overtime to the creation of a tight community. These households formed an unique cluster formalized through required membership in a housing society, which provides a venue for self-governance, utilities management, dispute resolution, and social interactions. The security of tenure and the buy-in of the residents offered the right incentives for the continued investment and sustainability of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The capstone team conducted 62 interviews across 5 sectors from Charkop. The chosen sectors - 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 -  were selected given their different plot sizes, the courtyard layouts and their location relative to the main arteries of the neighborhood. The map above displays the boundaries for the seven original sectors and includes both socioeconomic characteristics and quotes by interviewed residents.</p>

<p>The map above displays the ownership information of all households visited and provides us with important insights related not only with the fact that most participants are owners, but also, with the possible connection between their status and the emergence of enfranchisement amongst residents.</p>
